# Computational Madness
Some experiments i wrote trying to estimate pi with the Monte Carlo method.  

This has nothing to do with [MADNESS (Multiresolution Adaptive Numerical Environment for Scientific Simulation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MADNESS)

For more details please refer to my blogposts (in Italian):
